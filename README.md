# Interactive Protocol - Smart Contracts

The smart contracts of the Interactive Protocol facilitate the interaction between users and nodes in a decentralized and secure manner. This repository contains the Solidity smart contract code for the Interactive Protocol.

## Contracts

- `InteractiveProtocol.sol`: The main contract that manages the computation tasks, bidding mechanism, and task completion.
- Other supporting contracts (if any)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/Interactive-Protocol/contracts.git`
2. Install the necessary dependencies: `npm install`

## Usage

1. Deploy the `InteractiveProtocol.sol` contract to your desired Ethereum network using your preferred development environment (e.g., Remix, Truffle, Hardhat).
2. Interact with the deployed contract using the provided functions to submit tasks, bid for tasks, and complete tasks.
3. Customize the contract's behavior by modifying the code or extending it with additional functionality as per your project requirements.

## Testing

1. Run the contract tests: `npm run test`
2. The test suite ensures the correctness and functionality of the Interactive Protocol smart contracts.
